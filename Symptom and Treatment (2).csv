0,Apple Scab,"The first signs of apple scab often are not noticed. These signs include twisted and puckered leaves that have black, circular scabby spots on the underside. On the upper surface the spots look velvety and have an olive-green, sooty appearance. The spots may fuse and cover the whole leaf. As the disease progresses, the leaves yellow and drop. The fruit develops scabby spots that are tan and sunken. Apple scab may be confused with cedar-apple rust, also a fungal disease. Cedar-apple rust can also cause yellowing leaves, but the spots are bright yellow with a dark center of black fruiting bodies.","Foliar applications of Propizol in crabapple trees. Alternatively, apply Propizol by trunk injection. Make applic1. Live with the disease. Apple scab rarely kills trees and the severity of infection will vary from year to year depending upon climatic conditions. Give more attention to young trees that may not establish well if prematurely defoliated. Also take note of any trees that become weakened through several years of defoliation and act accordingly.

2. Keep plants healthy. A tree that is watered during dry periods will be better able to withstand periodic defoliation.

3. Clean up and destroy infected leaves. The fungus overwinters on infected leaves; therefore, it is important to rake up and destroy leaves in the fall. Since the spores also travel on the wind, cleaning up leaves may be only partially effective.

4. Prune trees to allow good air circulation. Allowing for better air movement will allow leaves to dry more quickly and help prevent infection from occurring. Do not use overhead watering.

5. Apply fungicidal sprays to susceptible trees if clean foliage is necessary or if defoliation reduces fruiting on eating apples. sulfur can be used but it must be applied before the fungal spores germinate. Chemicals registered for use include chlorothalonil (Daconil), copper, ferbam, fosetyl- Al, mancozeb, maneb, thiram, triflumizole, and ziram. Fungicidal sprays must be applied before infection as a preventive to be effective.

6. Replace the tree with a variety resistant to apple scab. Resistant varieties of eating apples include: ‘Florina’, ‘Freedom’, ‘Gavin’, ‘Jonafree’, ‘Liberty’, ‘Macfree’, ‘Nova Easygro’, ‘Novamac’, ‘Priam’, ‘Prima’, ‘Priscilla’, ‘Redfree’, and ‘Sir Prize’. Many resistant crabapple varieties are available at nurseries and garden centers or through mail order sources.ations when the trees are in full leaf and actively growing for control of the next season’s leaf disease development.",Apple
1,Apple Black Rot,"Large brown rotten areas can form anywhere on the fruit but are most common on the blossom end. Brown to black concentric rings can often be seen on larger infections.
The flesh of the apple is brown but remains firm.
Small, black spots can be seen on older fruit infections. These are fungal spore producing structures, called pycnidia.
Some fruit mummify (shrivel and dry out) and remain attached to the tree.
Occasionally fruit are infected early in the season. This results in fruit that ripen early and are rotten at the core.","Prune out dead or diseased branches.
Pick all dried and shriveled fruits remaining on the trees.
Remove infected plant material from the area.
All infected plant parts should be burned, buried or sent to a municipal composting site.
Be sure to remove the stumps of any apple trees you cut down. Dead stumps can be a source of spores.",Apple
2,Cedar  Apple Rust,"On leaves: Large yellow spots appear on cedar-hawthorn rust the upper surface of the leaves turning yellow orange to gray-brown as the spores mature. When rust is severe, all the foliage may turn bright yellow and drop prematurely. The orange leaf spots are smaller on apple and crabapple.

On fruits and twigs: Deformation of fruits and young twigs is particularly severe on hawthorns, but this damage is usually caused by the cedar-quince rust fungi and not cedar hawthorn rust fungi.

On juniper: Cedar-hawthorn rust galls are smaller in size than cedar-apple rust galls, less symmetrical, and more chocolate-brown in color. Galls remain on the twigs of branches of junipers for several years, where they continue to produce spores, compared to the one season spore production of cedar-apple rust.","Cultural Control
Because this disease requires two hosts, the separation of the hosts for a distance of one mile will help reduce infection. Ideally, to minimize disease host availability, plant trees and shrubs that are resistant to rust diseases. There are many apples, crabapples, hawthorns, and junipers that exhibit resistance to these diseases. The Morton Arboretum publication Crabapples for the Home Landscape provides information on selecting crabapples.

Chemical Control
Protective fungicides can be applied to help minimize infection. A minimum of three applications should be done. These applications protect the new leaves from spores that are dispersed from the juniper host in mid-spring. Spraying apple, crabapple, and hawthorn foliage after symptoms develop has no controlling effect.
Apples and Crabapples: Begin spraying when new growth appears and flower buds show color but are not yet open. Repeat three to four times at 10 to 14 day intervals.",Apple

5,Cherry Powdery Mildew,"Leaves-the first symptom is a light-green, circular lesion on either leaf surface. A subtle white cotton-like growth develops in the infected area. Mycelial growth can be sparse and difficult to detect. Early symptoms can be easier to find when the sun is over the back of your shoulder highlighting the colony. Severe leaf infection can result in curling and/or blistering, and leaves are covered with the characteristic white cotton-like growth. As infected leaves age, small, black bodies (chasmothecia) are formed.

Fruit-circular, slightly depressed areas develop late in the season on the surface. Symptoms gradually start at the stem cavity (stem/fruit attachment zone) and radiate out onto the fruit from there. A subtle white, cotton-like growth may or may not develop but can cover the entire fruit surface.","Manage irrigation. In the arid west in a typical dry spring, early irrigation may stimulate early cherry powdery mildew infections. For example, in 2002 Dr. Gary Grove documented the initiation of cherry powdery mildew infections in relationship to spring irrigation. Initial symptoms appeared 7-10 days after the first irrigation of the season in all five orchards monitored. Generally, the ground is still moist in spring and early irrigation may only jumpstart your powdery mildew season versus help your trees. Recent research has shown that a two-week delay in irrigation delayed disease initiation two weeks with no negative impact on fruit.
Pruning. Humid conditions favor cherry powdery mildew. A well pruned canopy will promote more air flow and leaf drying, reducing these humid conditions favorable for disease. Pruning will also help to achieve good spray coverage.",Cherry

7,Corn Gray Leaf Spot,"The disease first appears in the form of small, necrotic spots with halos. These usually expand to become rectangular lesions, about 1/8 inch wide by up to 2 inches to 3 inches long and gray to brown in appearance. Mature lesions usually have distinct parallel edges and appear opaque when put up to the light, but the lesions hybrids vary widely in shape and color. Symptoms can sometimes be confused with northern corn leaf spot, although gray leaf spot lesions are usually limited on the sides by veins.","Disease management tactics include using resistant corn hybrids, conventional tillage where appropriate, and crop rotation. Foliar fungicides can be effective if economically warranted. Typically they are only profitable on susceptible inbreds or susceptible hybrids under a combination of high risk conditions with high yield potential, prolonged humid conditions, and evidence of disease development.",Corn
8,Corn Common Rust,"Lesions begin as flecks on leaves that develop into small tan spots
Spots turn into elongated brick-red to cinnamon-brown pustules with jagged appearance
Found on both upper AND lower leaf surfaces (unlike southern rust)
Pustules turn dark brown to black late in the season
Occurs on leaf only, NOT on sheaths, stalks, ear shanks and husk leaves","Genetic Resistance
Pioneer researchers screen hybrids and parent lines for resistance and provide ratings for customers
Most hybrids are rated from “3” to “6” on a scale of 1 to 9 (9=resistant), indicating there are clear differences between hybrids, but complete resistance is not available
Growers should choose hybrids with a “5” or “6” rating in areas that frequently experience common rust
Scout corn to detect common rust early
Monitor disease development, crop growth stage and weather forecast
Apply a foliar fungicide if:
Rust is spreading rapidly or likely to spread and yield may be affected

9,Corn Northern Leaf Blight,"Typical symptoms of northern corn leaf blight are canoe-shaped lesions 1 inch to 6 inches long. The lesions are initially bordered by gray-green margins. They eventually turn tan colored and may contain dark areas of fungal sporulation. The length or size of lesions may vary with in different corn hybrids reactions with different resistance genes. Lesions begin on the lower leaves and then spread to upper leaves. Severe symptoms can progress rapidly, resulting in blighted leaves. The disease can be confused with symptoms of Goss's leaf blight on some hybrids, and perhaps with Stewarts wilt where this disease occurs.","CULTURAL CONTROL

Before planting:

Choose hybrid varieties with known resistance to maize northern leaf blight; this is the most important way of managing the disease.
During growth:

Make sure that the plants have adequate nutrients. Do not over supply nitrogen, but make sure phosphorus and potassium are at optimal levels.
Control weeds, especially grasses that might be alternative hosts of the fungus.
After harvest:

Collect the remains of the crop and destroy by burning or burying.
Practise crop rotation; rotate with non-grass crops.
RESISTANT VARIETIES
There are resistant hybrid varieties to this disease; check those available from retailers in your country.

CHEMICAL CONTROL
Chemical control should not be necessary for the management of this disease, and its use is unlikely to bring economic returns. However, if fungicides are needed, use chlorothalonil or mancozeb.",Corn

11,Grape Black Rot,"Symptoms of black rot first appear as small yellow spots on leaves. Enlarged spots (lesions) have a dark brownish-red border with tan to dark brown centers. As the infection develops, tiny black dots appear in the lesion, usually in a ring pattern near the border of the lesion. These dots are fungal structures (pycnidia), which contain thousands of spores (conidia) that can infect new tissue. New infections can occur in less than 10 hours at temperatures between 60 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit.","Cultural Practices
For new grape plantings, select a sunny location that allows for good air movement. Orient rows with the prevailing winds to allow plants to dry quickly during wet weather.

Sanitation
Sanitation plays an important part in limiting the amount of black rot inoculum found in a vineyard. If only a few leaf lesions appear in the spring, these should be removed. The removal of diseased tendrils and canes through pruning during the dormant season will reduce the amount of spores available to cause infections in the spring. However, the removal of mummies either on the vineyard floor or remaining in the canopy, will have the largest impact in reducing black rot disease in the vineyard. Mummies in the canopy provide inoculum much later into the season than those that have fallen to the vineyard floor and thus should be given priority for removal. In small plantings, removal of diseased fruit when they are first observed is encouraged. Any mummies remaining in the canopy at the end of the season should be dropped to the ground and buried.

Chemical control
Fungicides, applied early in the growing season, are a critical component of a black rot management program. The most effective spray program targets the period prior to bloom when spore production peaks. Fungicides should be sprayed during the period from early bloom through three to four weeks after bloom.",Grape
12,Grape Esca (Black Measles),"Esca, Botryosphaeria dieback, Eutypa dieback, and Phomopsis dieback make up a complex of ""trunk diseases"" caused by different wood-infecting fungi. The foliar symptom of Esca is an interveinal ""striping"". The ""stripes"", which start out as dark red in red cultivars and yellow in white cultivars, dry and become necrotic. Foliar symptoms may occur at any time during the growing season, but are most prevalent during July and August. They are often restricted to an individual shoot or to shoots originating from the same spur or cane. Symptomatic leaves can dry completely and drop prematurely. On berries, small, round, dark spots each bordered by a brown-purple ring, may occur. These fruit spots, which are better viewed on white cultivars, may appear at any time between fruit set and ripening. In severely affected vines, the berries often crack and dry or are subject to spoilage.","Presently, there are no effective management strategies for measles. Wine grape growers with small vineyards will often have field crews remove infected fruit prior to harvest. Raisins affected by measles will be discarded during harvest or at the packing house, while table grape growers will leave affected fruit on the vine. Current research is focused on protecting pruning wounds from fungal infections to minimize suspect fungi from colonizing fresh wounds.",Grape
13,Grape Leaf Blight (Isariopsis Leaf Spot),On leaf surface we will see lesions which are irregularly shaped (2 to 25 mm in diameter). Initially lesions are dull red to brown in color turn black later. If disease is severe this lesions may coalesce. On berries we can see symptom similar to black rot but the entire clusters will collapse.,"Spray baking soda solution (a tablespoon of baking soda, 2 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, a teaspoon of liquid soap, not detergent, to one gallon of water), or neem oil (do not use when pollinating insects including bees or other beneficial insects are present).",Grape

15,Orange Haunglongbing (Citrus Greening),"HLB is distinguished by the common symptoms of yellowing of the veins and adjacent tissues; followed by splotchy mottling of the entire leaf, premature defoliation, dieback of twigs, decay of feeder rootlets and lateral roots, and decline in vigor, ultimately followed by the death of the entire plant. Affected trees have stunted growth, bear multiple off-season flowers (most of which fall off), and produce small, irregularly shaped fruit with a thick, pale peel that remains green at the bottom and tastes very bitter. Common symptoms can often be mistaken for nutrient deficiencies; however, the distinguishing factor between nutrient deficiencies is the pattern of symmetry. Nutrient deficiencies tend to be symmetrical along the leaf vein margin, while HLB has an asymmetrical yellowing around the vein. The most noticeable symptom of HLB is greening and stunting of the fruit, especially after ripening.","Some cultural practices can be effective in monitoring this disease. Cultural methods include antibacterial management, sanitation, removal of infected plants, frequent scouting, and most importantly, crisis declaration. Tracking the disease will help prevent further infection in other affected areas and help mitigate more local infections if detected early enough. The Asian citrus psyllid has alternative hosts that may attract psyllids to citrus plants in the vicinity such as Murraya paniculata, Severinia buxifolia, and other plants in the family Rutaceae.",Orange
16,Peach Bacterial Spot,"Numerous small spots form on the leaves. The spots are angular, purple to purplish-brown or black. Spots may merge and the centers may fall out, giving the characteristic “shothole” appearance. Heavily infected leaves turn yellow and drop. Severe leaf loss early in the summer reduces fruit size and weakens the tree. A few lesions can result in severe defoliation on sensitive varieties; tolerant varieties may require many more lesions for defoliation.","Bacterial spot is very diffi cult to control during rainy seasons. No entirely satisfactory control method is known. Homeowners are particularly limited as to chemicals available to them for bacterial spot control. Proper cultural practices are important in minimizing this disease.
1. Resistance to bacterial spot should be a primary consideration in peach varietal selection. Some of the more resistant varieties include Bell of Georgia, Biscoe, Harken, Loring, Madison, Ranger, Redhaven, Redskin and Sunhaven. Very susceptible varieties include Elberta, July Elberta, Halehaven, Rio-Oso-Gem and Sunhigh.
2. Vigorous trees are less susceptible to the disease than weak, neglected trees. Fertilize according to a soil test, to maintain vigorous, but not excessive, shoot growth.
3. Allow for good air circulation by avoiding low-lying orchard sites and by adhering to correct pruning practices. Prune during dry weather in the latter part of the dormant season.",Peach

18,Pepper Bell Bacterial Spot,"Symptoms begin as small, yellow-green lesions on young leaves which usually appear deformed and twisted, or as dark, water soaked, greasy-appearing lesions on older foliage. Lesions develop rapidly to a size of 0.25 to 0.5 cm (0.1 to 0.2 in.) wide and become tan to brownish-red. Lesion shape is defined by leaf veinlets, so the shape is angular rather than the round shape that is more typical of fungal leaf spots or injury caused by some pesticides or other chemical sprays.

Lesions often are more numerous at the tip and margin of the leaf where moisture such as dew is retained. Under dry conditions, diseased leaves can develop a tattered appearance as the leaf margin and lesion centers become necrotic, dry up and disintegrate. Lesion size is often larger and symptoms are more severe when extended periods (> 12 hours) of moisture-saturated tissue occur.","Select resistant varieties
Purchase disease-free seed and transplants.
Treat seeds by soaking them for 2 minutes in a 10% chlorine bleach solution (1 part bleach; 9 parts water). Thoroughly rinse seeds and dry them before planting.
Mulch plants deeply with a thick organic material like newspaper covered with straw or grass clippings.
Avoid overhead watering.
Remove and discard badly infected plant parts and all debris at the end of the season.

20,Potato Early Blight,"The first symptoms of early blight appear as small, circular or irregular, dark-brown to black spots on the older (lower). These spots enlarge up to 3/8 inch in diameter and gradually may become angular-shaped. Initial lesions on young, fully expanded leaves may be confused with brown spot lesions. These first lesions appear about two to three days after infection, with further sporulation on the surface of these lesions occurring three to five days later.","Select a late-season variety with a lower susceptibility to early blight. (Resistance is associated with plant maturity and early maturing cultivars are more susceptible).
Time irrigation to minimize leaf wetness duration during cloudy weather and allow sufficient time for leaves to dry prior to nightfall.
Avoid nitrogen and phosphorus deficiency.
Scout fields regularly for infection beginning after plants reach 12 inches in height. Pay particular attention to edges of fields that are adjacent to fields planted to potato the previous year.",Potato
21,Potato Late Blight,"The first symptoms of late blight in the field are small, light to dark green, circular to irregular-shaped water-soaked spots. These lesions usually appear first on the lower leaves. Lesions often begin to develop near the leaf tips or edges, where dew is retained the longest. During cool, moist weather, these lesions expand rapidly into large, dark brown or black lesions, often appearing greasy (Figure 2). Leaf lesions also frequently are surrounded by a yellow chlorotic halo.","Destroy all cull and volunteer potatoes.
Plant late blight-free seed tubers.
Do not mix seed lots because cutting can transmit late blight.
Use a seed piece fungicide treatment labeled for control of late blight (current list of fungicides can be found in the NDSU “Fungicide Guide,” PP622). Recommended seed treatments include Revus, Reason and mancozeb.
Avoid planting problem areas that may remain wet for extended periods or may be difficult to spray (the center of the pivot, along powerlines and tree lines).

White powdery spots can form on both upper and lower leaf surfaces, and quickly expand into large blotches. The large blotches can cover entire leaf, petiole and stem surfaces.
When powdery mildew infects the majority of the foliage, the plant weakens and the fruit ripens prematurely.","Plant varieties with complete or partial resistance to powdery mildew.
Apply fertilizer based on soil test results. Avoid over-applying nitrogen.
Provide good air movement around plants through proper spacing, staking of plants and weed control.
Once a week, examine five mature leaves for powdery mildew infection. In large plantings, repeat at 10 different locations in the field.
If susceptible varieties are growing in an area where powdery mildew has resulted in yield loss in the past, fungicide may be necessary.
Apply fungicides after finding the first spot of powdery mildew.
Home gardeners can apply sulfur products to both the upper and lower surface of the leaves.",Squash
26,Strawberry Leaf Scorch,"Leaf scorch is caused by the fungus Diplocarpon earliana. Symptoms of leaf scorch consist of numerous small, irregular, purplish spots or “blotches” that develop on the upper surface of leaves. The centers of the blotches become brownish. Blotches may coalesce until they nearly cover the leaflet, which then appears purplish to reddish to brown.

The fungus overwinters on infected leaves. The fungus produces spore forming structures in the spring on both surfaces of dead leaves. These structures produce spores abundantly in midsummer. In the presence of free water, these spores can germinate and infect the plant within 24 hours. Older and middle-aged leaves are infected more easily than young ones.","Remove the older and infected leaves from runner plants before setting.
Take care in spacing runner plants in matted-row culture.
Plant in light, well-drained soil in a location exposed to all-day sun and good air circulation.

28,Tomato Bacterial Spot,"Bacterial spot can affect all above ground parts of a tomato plant, including the leaves, stems, and fruit.  Bacterial spot appears on leaves as small (less than ⅛ inch), sometimes water-soaked (i.e., wet-looking) circular areas.  Spots may initially be yellow-green, but darken to brownish-red as they age.  When the disease is severe, extensive leaf yellowing and leaf loss can also occur.  On green fruit, spots are typically small, raised and blister-like, and may have a yellowish halo.  As fruit mature, the spots enlarge (reaching a maximum size of ¼ inch) and turn brown, scabby and rough.  Mature spots may be raised, or sunken with raised edges.  Bacterial spot symptoms can be easily confused with symptoms of another tomato disease called bacterial speck.","Plant pathogen-free seed or transplants to prevent the introduction of bacterial spot pathogens on contaminated seed or seedlings.  If a clean seed source is not available or you suspect that your seed is contaminated, soak seeds in water at 122°F for 25 min. to kill the pathogens.  To keep leaves dry and to prevent the spread of the pathogens, avoid overhead watering (e.g., with a wand or sprinkler) of established plants and instead use a drip-tape or soaker-hose.  Also to prevent spread, DO NOT handle plants when they are wet (e.g., from dew) and routinely sterilize tools with either 10% bleach solution or (better) 70% alcohol (e.g., rubbing alcohol).  Where bacterial spot has been a recurring problem, consider using preventative applications of copper-based products registered for use on tomato, especially during warm, wet periods.  Keep in mind however, that if used excessively or for prolonged periods, copper may no longer control the disease.",Tomato

Early blight stem infection
Seedling stems are infected at or just above the soil line. The stem turns brown, sunken and dry (collar rot).
If the infection girdles the stem, the seedling wilts and dies.
Stem infections on older plants are oval to irregular, dry brown areas with dark brown concentric rings.

Rotate out of tomatoes and related crops for at least two years.
Control susceptible weeds such as black nightshade and hairy nightshade, and volunteer tomato plants throughout the rotation.
Fertilize properly to maintain vigorous plant growth. Particularly, do not over-fertilize with potassium and maintain adequate levels of both nitrogen and phosphorus.
Avoid working in plants when they are wet from rain, irrigation, or dew.
Use drip irrigation instead of overhead irrigation to keep foliage dry.

Resistant varieties should be used in combination with cultural control practices as part of an integrated disease management program.
There are currently 12 known races of P. fulva.
Each resistant cultivar protects against only one to a few races.
It is currently unknown which races of P. fulva exist in the United States of America. Therefore it is unknown which varieties will effectively reduce disease.

32,Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot,"Septoria leaf spot usually appears on the lower leaves after the first fruit sets. Spots are circular, about 1/16 to 1/4 inch in diameter with dark brown margins and tan to gray centers with small black fruiting structures. Characteristically, there are many spots per leaf. This disease spreads upwards from oldest to youngest growth. If leaf lesions are numerous, the leaves turn slightly yellow, then brown, and then wither. Fruit infection is rare.","1. Remove diseased leaves. If caught early, the lower infected leaves can be removed and burned or destroyed. However, removing leaves above where fruit has formed will weaken the plant and expose fruit to sunscald. At the end of the season, collect all foliage from infected plants and dispose of or bury. Do not compost diseased plants.

2. Improve air circulation around the plants. If the plants can still be handled without breaking them, stake or cage the plants to raise them off the ground and promote faster drying of the foliage.

3. Mulch around the base of the plants. Mulching will reduce splashing soil, which may contain fungal spores associated with debris. Apply mulch after the soil has warmed.

4. Do not use overhead watering. Overhead watering facilitates infection and spreads the disease. Use a soaker hose at the base of the plant to keep the foliage dry. Water early in the day.

5. Control weeds. Nightshade and horsenettle are frequently hosts of Septoria leaf spot and should be eradicated around the garden site.",Tomato
33,Tomato Spider Mites Two-spotted Spider Mite,"Generally, mites feed on the undersides of leaves. They use their sucking mouthparts to remove sap from plants, giving the upper leaf surface a speckled or mottled appearance. Leaves of mite-infested plants may turn yellow and dry up, and plants may lose vigor and die when infestations are severe. The undersides of affected leaves appear tan or yellow and have a crusty texture. Heavy infestations of the two‑spotted spider mite produce fine webbing that may cover the entire plant. Mites are identified by shaking symptomatic leaves onto a sheet of white paper or by observing infected leaf areas with a hand lens. In hot dry weather, mites can cause plants to drop leaves in a few weeks.","Natural enemies of mites are present in and around fields and can keep mite populations low. Many insecticides used for control of insect pests severely reduce numbers of beneficial insects that keep mite populations in check. Therefore, apply insecticides only as‑needed, rather than at regularly scheduled intervals. When possible, select pesticides which will have the least impact on beneficial insects. Destruction of weeds adjacent to and in fields is done in the fall or early spring. Growers should manage weeds around fields carefully during the season. Grass must be mowed regularly. Spraying or mowing of weeds after growth has become rank may increase the movement of mites to cultivated plants. ",Tomato
34,Tomato Target Spot,"The fruit displays circular spots with concentric, target-like rings and a velvety black, fungal lesions in the center. The “targets” become pitted and larger as the tomato matures.","Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season, otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores.",Tomato
35,Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus,"Leaves of infected plants are small and curl upward; and show strong crumpling and interveinal and marginal yellowing. The internodes of infected plants become shortened and, together with the stunted growth, plants often take on a bushy appearance, which is sometimes referred to as 'bonsai' or broccoli'-like growth. Flowers formed on infected plants commonly do not develop and fall off (abscise). Fruit production is dramatically reduced, particularly when plants are infected at an early age, and it is not uncommon for losses of 100% to be experienced in fields with heavily infected plants.","Plant immediately after any tomato-free period or true winter season.
Avoid planting new fields near older fields (especially those with TYLCV-infected plants).
Cover plants with floating row covers of fine mesh (Agryl or Agribon) to protect from whitefly infestations.
Rogue diseased plants when incidence of virus infection is low.
Practice good weed management in and around fields to the extent feasible.  
Remove and destroy old crop residue and volunteers on a regional basis.
A voluntary or enforced regional host-free period in areas lacking a true winter season (i.e., temperatures low enough to prevent crop cultivation and whitefly survival) might be a useful management tool. The crops to be included in a region will depend on the agroecosystem.",Tomato
