0,Apple Scab,"Brownish-green spots appear on the leaves or fruit. As the infection progresses, the spots become darker and more prominent and take on a velvety texture due to spore (conidia) formation.","Foliar applications of Propizol in crabapple trees. Alternatively, apply Propizol by trunk injection. Make applications when the trees are in full leaf and actively growing for control of the next season’s leaf disease development."
1,Apple Black Rot,Large brown rotten areas can form anywhere on the fruit but are most common on the blossom end.,Keep all the fallen debris and dead fruit cleaned up and away from the tree.
2,Cedar  Apple Rust,"On apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead-sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify.","Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labelled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. "

5,Cherry Powdery Mildew,Plants infected with powdery mildew look as if they have been dusted with flour.,"Once plants are heavily infected, it’s very difficult to get rid of the disease, so focus on preventing it from spreading to other plants. Remove all infected foliage, stems, and fruit and destroy them, either by throwing them in the trash or by burning."
6,Healthy Cherry,Normal,Nothing
7,Corn Gray Leaf Spot,"Leaf lesions, discolouration (chlorosis), and foliar blight. Distinct symptoms of GLS are rectangular, brown to grey necrotic lesions that run parallel to the leaf, spanning the spaces between the secondary leaf veins.","Burying the debris under the last year’s crop will help in reducing the presence of fungus, as the fungal-infected debris can only survive above the soil surface."
8,Corn Common Rust,"Tiny, yellow, pinprick spots appear on leaves. Seven days after these symptoms appear, they develop into reddish-brown pustules that are formed on the upper and lower surface of the leaf.","To reduce the incidence of corn rust, plant only corn that has resistance to the fungus. Resistance is either in the form of race-specific resistance or partial rust resistance."
9,Corn Northern Leaf Blight,"Formation of lesions on the leaves. They are long, narrow lesions that eventually turn brown. The lesions may also form greyish coloured borders around their edges.","The fungus overwinters in plant material, so it is also important to manage infected plants. Tilling the corn into the soil is one strategy, but with a small garden it may make more sense to just remove and destroy the affected plants."

11,Grape Black Rot,"The earliest signs of disease appear as yellow circular lesions on young leaves. As these lesions spread, they brown and sprout black fungal fruiting bodies that look similar to grains of pepper.","During your fall clean-up, make sure that all mummies have been removed from the vine and all plant material on the ground below is destroyed. Prune out any and all areas with lesions."
12,Grape Esca (Black Measles),"The ""stripes"", which start out as dark red in red cultivars and yellow in white cultivars, dry and become necrotic.",There are no effective management strategies for measles. Best thing to do would be to remove infected fruit prior to harvest.
13,Grape Leaf Blight (Isariopsis Leaf Spot),"Infected plants have brown or black water-soaked spots on the foliage, sometimes with a yellow halo, usually uniform in size.","Spray baking soda solution (a tablespoon of baking soda, 2 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, a teaspoon of liquid soap, not detergent, to one gallon of water), or neem oil (do not use when pollinating insects including bees or other beneficial insects are present)."
14,Healthy Grape,Normal,Nothing
15,Orange Haunglongbing (Citrus Greening),"Lopsided, bitter, hard fruit with small, dark aborted seeds and Fruit that remains green even when ripe.","To slow the progression of citrus greening in infected trees, trace amounts of nutrients are applied to the leaves or to the roots. Providing better nutrition helps trees fight against citrus greening and enables them to continue to produce quality fruit for an extended period of time."
16,Peach Bacterial Spot,"Dark, small lesions, often clustered at the leaf tip where water collects during dews and rain. Leaf tissue around lesions can turn yellow.","Resistance to bacterial spot should be a primary consideration in peach varietal selection. Some of the more resistant varieties include Bell of Georgia, Biscoe, Harken, Loring, Madison, Ranger, Redhaven, Redskin and Sunhaven."
17,Healthy Peach,Normal,Nothing
18,Pepper Bell Bacterial Spot,"Bacterial leaf spot causes lesions on the leaves that look as though they are soaked with water. These lesions normally begin on the lower leaves. As the disease progresses, it leaves a dark, purple-brown spot with a light brown center.","At the end of the season, remove all crop debris from the garden and destroy it. Do not compost plant debris that may contain the disease. Once the area is clean of all visible debris, till the soil or turn it with a shovel to bury any remaining bacteria."

20,Potato Early Blight,"Early blight rarely affects young plants. Symptoms first occur on the lower or oldest leaves of the plant. Dark, brown spots appear on this older foliage and, as the disease progresses, enlarge, taking on an angular shape. These lesions often look like a target and, in fact, the disease is sometimes referred to as target spot.","Plant potato varieties that are resistant to the disease, late maturing are more resistant than early maturing varieties."
21,Potato Late Blight,"Late blight first appears on the lower, older leaves as water-soaked, gray-green spots. As the disease matures, these spots darken and a white fungal growth forms on the undersides.","Apply a copper based fungicide every 7 days or less, following heavy rain or when the amount of disease is increasing rapidly. If possible, time applications so that at least 12 hours of dry weather follows application."

25,Squash Powdery Mildew,"White or gray powdery spots appear, often times covering most if not the entire leaf surface. It’s also found on plant stems, flowers and even fruit.",Off-the-shelf fungicide products that are effective at treating mildew. One of the most common active ingredients used for control is “chlorothalonil”.
26,Strawberry Leaf Scorch,Strawberries with leaf scorch may first show signs of issue with the development of small purplish blemishes that occur on the topside of leaves.,"Remove infected garden debris from the strawberry patch, as well as the frequent establishment of new strawberry transplants. The creation of new plantings and strawberry patches is key to maintaining a consistent strawberry harvest, as older plants are more likely to show signs of severe infection."
27,Healthy Strawberry ,,
28,Tomato Bacterial Spot,"The first signs of bacterial spot infestation is the appearance of small, irregular, oily marks on the underside of the tomato plant’s leaves. The lesions start as dark green spots and gradually shift to purple and eventually turn grey with black centers, sometimes with a white or yellowish outer ring.",Use copper fungicide as a preventive measure after you’ve planted your seeds but before you’ve moved the plants into their permanent homes.
29,Tomato Early Blight,"Tomatoes affected by early blight will have oval-shaped irregular brown or black spots on older leaves which become noticeable ten days after the infection begins. These spots will develop multiple rings, creating a target-like design as the disease progresses further.","Early blight, or A. solani, can be reversed if spotted early enough in the infestation, saving the plant by removing and disposing of infected parts of the plant and treating with a copper fungicide."
30,Tomato Late Blight,"Small lesions appear on stems, leaves, or fruit. If the weather is damp and the temperature moderate the pathogen would sporulate around these lesions and the late blight tomato disease will be ready to spread to the rest of the garden and beyond.","There are some fixed copper products approved for use; otherwise, all infected plants must be immediately removed and destroyed."
31,Tomato Leaf Mold,"The topside of the leaves start to develop small gray, yellow, white, or pale green patches. The underside of the leaves begin to develop a fuzzy texture and turn purple.",Keep the leaves as dry as possible during the watering process. Calcium chloride-based sprays are recommended for treating leaf mold issues. Organic fungicide options are also available.
32,Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot,"Septoria leaf spots start off somewhat circular and first appear on the undersides of older leaves, at the bottom of the plant. They are small, 1/16 to 1/8 inches (1.6 to 3.2 millimeters) in diameter, with a dark brown margin and lighter gray or tan centers. A yellow halo may surround the spot.",Fungicides containing either copper or potassium bicarbonate will help prevent the spreading of the disease. Begin spraying as soon as the first symptoms appear and follow the label directions for continued management.
33,Tomato Spider Mites Two-spotted Spider Mite,"An infested tomato plant displays tiny spots on the leaves. If left untreated, the pests spin cottony webs on the foliage; eventually, the leaves turn brown or yellow and drop from the plant.","Prune leaves, stems and other infested parts of plants well past any webbing and discard in trash (and not in compost piles). "
34,Tomato Target Spot,"The fruit displays circular spots with concentric, target-like rings and a velvety black, fungal lesions in the center. The “targets” become pitted and larger as the tomato matures.","Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season, otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew. Dispose of the debris properly and don’t place it on your compost pile unless you’re sure your compost gets hot enough to kill the spores."
35,Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus,"Typical symptoms for this disease in tomato are yellow (chlorotic) leaf edges, upward leaf cupping, leaf mottling, reduced leaf size, and flower drop.","Use a neonicotinoid insecticide, such as dinotefuran (Venom) imidacloprid (AdmirePro, Alias, Nuprid, Widow, and others) or thiamethoxam (Platinum), as a soil application or through the drip irrigation system at transplanting of tomatoes or peppers."
36,Tomato Mosaic Virus,"Yellow, white or green stripes/ streaks/ spots on foliage, Wrinkled, curled or small leaves, Pronounced yellowing only of veins.","Treat the spots with least-toxic, natural pest control products to reduce the number of disease carrying insects or remove and destroy all infected plants."
